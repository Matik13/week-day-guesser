# Week Day Guesser

This project is a simple web-based application designed to help users practice and memorize the [**Doomsday Algorithm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule). The algorithm, developed by [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway), is a mental calculation technique for determining the day of the week for any given date.

## Demo

[Week Day Guesser](https://matik13.github.io/week-day-guesser/)

## Features

- Randomly generates a date within a user-specified range of years.
- Allows users to guess the day of the week for the generated date.
- Provides immediate feedback on whether the guess was correct or not.
- Displays the correct day of the week if the guess is incorrect.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a training tool for mastering the Doomsday Algorithm. By repeatedly guessing the day of the week for random dates, users can improve their speed and accuracy in performing the calculation.

## How to Use

1. Enter the range of years in the input fields labeled "Rok od" (Year from) and "Rok do" (Year to).
2. Click the "Losuj datę" (Draw Date) button to generate a random date.
3. Guess the day of the week by clicking one of the buttons labeled with the days (e.g., "Poniedziałek" for Monday).
4. Receive feedback on whether your guess was correct or not.
